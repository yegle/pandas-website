If you have found *pandas* to be useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps! All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of the *pandas* Projects's open source software, documentation and community.

Donations are managed by the `NUMFocus <http://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects.html>`__ Foundation, which is the legal and fiscal umbrella for the project. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if you are subject to US Tax law, your contributions will be tax-deductible.

More specifically, donations can be used to work towards major improvements of the *pandas* Project, including:

* Fixing long-standing limitations or inconsistencies in missing data (null values in integer and boolean data, and a more consistent notion of null / NA).
* Improved performance and utilization of multicore systems.
* Better user control / visibility of memory usage.
* Clearer semantics around non-NumPy data types, and permitting new pandas-only data types to be added.
* Exposing a “libpandas” C/C++ API to other Python library developers.

More information about this can be found in the "pandas 2.0" design documents: https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas2/index.html
